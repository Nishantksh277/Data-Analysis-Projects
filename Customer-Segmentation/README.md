| **Recency** | Days since last purchase | Customer engagement level |
| **Frequency** | Total number of transactions | Purchase behavior loyalty |
| **Monetary** | Total revenue generated | Customer economic value |

### Machine Learning Pipeline
1. **Data Preprocessing** → Clean and validate transactional data
2. **Feature Engineering** → Calculate RFM metrics and derived features
3. **Scoring & Ranking** → Quantile-based RFM scoring (1-4 scale)
4. **Clustering Analysis** → K-Means algorithm with optimal cluster selection
5. **Validation & Insights** → Statistical validation and business interpretation
